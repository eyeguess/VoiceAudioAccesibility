## Description
Voice Audio Accessibility is a Lethal Company plugin which allows you to mute or reduce the volume of others when speaking (by proximity chat and by using the Walkie Talkie). 
It takes advantage of the `RemoteVoiceVolume` variable found in the class `DissonanceComms`, which is part of the `DissonanceVoip` Assembly.

As of right now the keybinds taken are:
- K - By keeping this button pressed, it mutes everyone with 100% effect.
- R - By keeping this button pressed, it lowers everyone's volume with 90% effect.

The keybinds and the percentage effect can be changed in the code.
